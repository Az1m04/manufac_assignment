## Wine Dataset Statistical Analysis

This project is a React application that performs statistical analysis on a wine dataset. It calculates class-wise statistics such as mean, median, and mode for the "Flavanoids" and "Gamma" properties of the dataset.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn `

Installs the required dependency to run the app.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# The application will display two tables:

The first table shows class-wise statistics for the "Flavanoids" property, including mean, median, and mode.
The second table shows class-wise statistics for the "Gamma" property, including mean, median, and mode.
